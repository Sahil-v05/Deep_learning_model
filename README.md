# Deep_learning_model
 #Task :- To implement a deep learning-based model that is capable of classifying anatomical structure in 2d fetal ultrasound images

     *Ultrasound is the safest, most accessible, affordable, and widely used method for the detection of multiple fetal anomalies. 
    
     *Accurate detection of planes is of utmost importance for the correct diagnosis of fetal abnormalities. The aim here is to train a classifier model for classifying the abdomen, thorax, 
      brain, and femur in fetal ultrasound images.
     
     *The dataset will be provided with the corresponding ground truth class.
